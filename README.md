# Digital Travel Memories

This is a fullstack project developed by Shreya Choure and Rutuja Padgilwar. We have worked togeter to create a application 'Memories'. In this application we are working mainly on JavaScript framework React. The application takes images and their respective details through a input form, and we are storing this data in the Firebase database. One of the features of the application include fetching all the photos from database and displaying it in an album. We have implemented Search feature, which is able to grab the images from the places given by user input.
